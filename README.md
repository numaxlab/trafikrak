Testa is a Galician term used in printing and binding referring to the top edge of a book.

It is also a comprehensive Laravel package that extends the [Lunar](https://lunarphp.io/) e-commerce platform. Testa
offers an opinionated, feature-rich solution specifically designed for building advanced, content-driven online stores
for bookshops.

This package is tailored for bookshops that utilize [Geslib](https://editorial.trevenque.es/productos/geslib/) as their
primary management system. It relies on the [numaxlab/lunar-geslib](https://github.com/numaxlab/lunar-geslib) package
for the core Geslib integration and complements it by providing a ready-to-use storefront implementation.

Furthermore, Testa expands Lunar's capabilities by integrating a full-featured educational platform, a
membership system, news and events management, and other key tools.

Testa was designed in a collaboration
between [Traficantes de Sueños](https://traficantes.net), [Katakrak](https://katakrak.net)
and [NUMAX](https://numax.org).

## Requirements

- PHP ^8.4
- Laravel
- [LunarPHP](https://lunarphp.io/docs/core/index.html)
- [Lunar Geslib](https://github.com/numaxlab/lunar-geslib)

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require numaxlab/testa
```

The package service provider will be auto-discovered by Laravel.

1. **Add the Filament Plugins to the Lunar Panel in the register method of your `AppServiceProvider`:**
   ```php
   LunarPanel::panel(function ($panel) {
        return $panel
            ->plugins([
                GeslibPlugin::make(),
                TestaPlugin::make(),
                ShippingPlugin::make(),
                SpatieLaravelTranslatablePlugin::make()
                    ->defaultLocales(['es', 'en']), // Setup the languages you want to use
            ]);
   })->register();
   ```

2. **Run the Installer Commands**

   This is a **crucial step**. The installer commands will set up required Lunar attributes, collection groups, tags,
   and
   seed initial data needed for the package to function correctly.

   ```bash
   php artisan lunar:geslib:install
   php artisan lunar:testa:install
   ```

## Testing

The package uses Pest for testing. You can run the tests using the following command:

```bash
composer test
```

Or

```bash
./vendor/bin/pest
```
